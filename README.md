Unreleased EP from Cpt. Sievert and Dr. Szliszka from 8bitcollective

﻿Back in 2009 or maybe 2008 on 8bitcollective, Cpt. Sievert and Dr. Szliszka did an epic back and forth thing.  The music is awesome.  Here is a forum post where µB (Szliszka) explains everything.

A link to the unreleased EP was posted.  The link is dead but I could get it with internet archive.

I am just posting everything from that link here for better preservation.  I am not Sievert nor Szliszka and I do not own any rights to this music.  If either artist wants this taken down, I will do so at their request.  This is just kickass music that is kind of borderline “lost web” and by putting it here I hope people can discover it and enjoy.
